                                    Marshall Ganz grew up in Bakersfield, California, where his father was a Rabbi and his mother, a teacher. He entered Harvard College in the fall of 1960. He left a year before graduating to volunteer with the 1964 Mississippi Summer Project. He found a “calling” as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and, in the fall of 1965, joined Cesar Chavez in his effort to unionize California farm workers. During 16 years with the United Farm Workers he gained experience in union, political, and community organizing, became Director of Organizing, and was elected to the national executive board on which he served for 8 years. During the 1980s, he worked with grassroots groups to develop new organizing programs and designed innovative voter mobilization strategies for local, state, and national electoral campaigns. In 1991, in order to deepen his intellectual understanding of his work, he returned to Harvard College and, after a 28-year “leave of absence,” completed his undergraduate degree in history and government. He was awarded an MPA by the Kennedy School in 1993 and completed his PhD in sociology in 2000. As senior lecturer in public policy at the Kennedy School of Government, he teaches, researches, and writes on leadership, organization, and strategy in social movements, civic associations, and politics. He has published in the <i>American Journal of Sociology, American Political Science Review, American Prospect,Washington Post, Los Angeles Times</i> and elsewhere. His newest book, <i>Why David Sometimes Wins: leadership, organization and strategy in the California farm worker movement</i> was published in 2009, earning the Michael J. Harrington Book Award of the American Political Science Association. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity by the Episcopal Divinity School in 2010.

                                    Marshall Ganz also teaches “Leadership, Organizing and Action: Leading Change” an online program designed to help leaders of civic associations, advocacy groups and social movements learn how to organize communities that can mobilize power to make change.

Dance Company, is renowned for pushing the boundaries to create contemporary works that blend dance, music, science, and art to engage in philosophical questions about the search for meaning. Rigorously trained in classical ballet, she has performed in Balanchine’s Grand Théâtre de Genève Company and in the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. As a choreographer, Armitage has created productions for the New York Philharmonic at Lincoln Center and many companies, from the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow to the Ballet de L’Opéra de Paris to the Tasmanian Dance Company in Australia. Armitage’s work is at once both esoteric and popular. She has choreographed Broadway productions (Passing Strange and Hair), videos for Madonna and Michael Jackson, several films for Merchant Ivory productions, and the Cirque du Soleil production, Amaluna. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, Armitage was named a Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France’s most prestigious award in 2009, and she holds an honorary Doctorate of the Arts from the University of Kansas (2013). She is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University and a Simons Fellow at The University of Kansas, studying Native American plains culture.

                                The Creative process continues to be a mystery to many of us. For some, it has to do with self-expression and communicating with the world around us. For others, it is an intimate and meditative path that guides them through life.

                                This is an interactive conversation (not a lecture). Participation from the attendees is encouraged.

                                <b>Abstract:</b>

                                While many scan the foreseeable time horizon looking for killer robots with glowing eyes, or for amorphous superintelligent puppet masters, humanity has been quietly augmenting itself with artificial intelligence for decades if not centuries.  To understand the long-term consequences of AI we need first to better examine our present.  Here in joint work with Aylin Caliskan-Islam and Arvind Narayanan I show that human-like semantic biases are present in standard the standard NLP tools GloVe and word2vec applied to their standard Web-sourced corpora.  We have replicated a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. I will describe these results, and also their implications both for human and AI ethics, which I will argue should be considered as one.

                                <b>Bio:</b>

                                Joanna Bryson is a Reader (tenured Associate Professor) at the University of Bath, currently visiting Princeton’s Center for Information Technology Policy (CITP). She has broad academic interests in the structure and utility of intelligence, both natural and artificial.   She is best known for her work in systems AI and AI ethics, both of which she began during her PhD in the 1990s, but she and her colleagues publish broadly, into biology, anthropology, sociology, philosophy, cognitive science, and politics.  She is currently collaborating on a project funded by Princeton’s University Center for Human Values, “Public Goods and Artificial Intelligence”, with Alin Coman of Princeton Psychology and Mark Riedl of Georgia Tech.  This project includes both basic research in human sociality and experiments in technological interventions.  Other current research includes work on understanding the causality behind the link between wealth inequality and political polarization, work on transparency in AI systems, and work on machine prejudice deriving from human semantics.  She holds degrees in Psychology from Chicago and Edinburgh, and in Artificial Intelligence from Edinburgh and MIT.  At Bath she founded the Intelligent Systems research group (one of four in the Department of Computer Science) and heads their Artificial Models of Natural Intelligence.

                                In 1991, Shaka Senghor was sent to prison for second-degree murder. Today, he is a lecturer at universities, a leading voice on criminal justice reform, and an inspiration to thousands.

                                In life, it’s not how you start that matters. It’s how you finish.

                                Shaka Senghor was raised in a middle class neighborhood on Detroit’s east side during the height of the 1980s crack epidemic. An honor roll student and a natural leader, he dreamed of becoming a doctor—but at age 11, his parents’ marriage began to unravel, and the beatings from his mother worsened, sending him on a downward spiral that saw him run away from home, turn to drug dealing to survive, and end up in prison for murder at the age of 19, fuming with anger and despair.

                                <a href="http://www.writingmywrongsbook.com/"><i>Writing My Wrongs</i></a> is the story of what came next. During his nineteen-year incarceration, seven of which were spent in solitary confinement, Senghor discovered literature, meditation, self-examination, and the kindness of others—tools he used to confront the demons of his past, forgive the people who hurt him, and begin atoning for the wrongs he had committed. Upon his release at age thirty-eight, Senghor became an activist and mentor to young men and women facing circumstances like his. His work in the community and the courage to share his story led him to fellowships at the MIT Media Lab and the Kellogg Foundation and invitations to speak at events like TED and the Aspen Ideas Festival.

                                In equal turns, <i>Writing My Wrongs</i> is a page-turning portrait of life in the shadow of poverty, violence, and fear; an unforgettable story of redemption, reminding us that our worst deeds don’t define us; and a compelling witness to our country’s need for rethinking its approach to crime, prison, and the men and women sent there.

                                <strong>Abstract:</strong>

                                Over the last four decades, America experienced a golden age of digital innovation. Yet during the same span of time, the rate of poverty stayed put, social mobility stagnated, and inequality skyrocketed to levels not seen for a century. How is it that our most advanced technologies failed to impact our deepest social challenges?

                                This talk presents technology’s Law of Amplification — a simple idea that explains why gadgets alone consistently fail to deliver social progress, and why in an age of advanced technology, it’s all the more important to focus on nurturing human wisdom.

                                For several years, The Kohala Center, the Edith Kanaka‘ole Foundation, and the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT have been in conversation about the possibility of connecting ancestral knowledge with research to address critical issues at the intersection of human and natural systems and science. These include energy self-reliance and food self-reliance. With a powerful and indigenous foundation of living in abundant self-reliance, of humanity living in kinship with nature, Hawai‘i operates with a spirit of aloha, a sense of generosity and care in communities both human and natural. And this despite the fact that Hawai‘i Island currently imports 85% of the food consumed on the island and is 95% dependent on fossil fuels for the production of energy. This dependence has a tremendous impact on the socio-economic and environmental health of Hawai‘i and the physical and spiritual health of its people. Thus, Hawai‘i models contemporary challenges, as well as indigenous success, with regard to sustainability and the well-being of our entire island planet.

                                Observations suggest a hiatus in global surface temperature rise since 1998, whereas most climate models simulate continued warming. What causes this difference? Do climate models respond too sensitively to the increase in greenhouse-gas concentrations such as that of CO2, and thus overestimate climate change systematically? Or has the discrepancy arisen by chance? And what is the relevance of this discrepancy for our assessment of long-term anthropogenic climate change?

                                In my lecture I will first illustrate the physically fundamental manifestation of anthropogenic climate change: the ocean’s heat content increases because of the greenhouse effect from rising greenhouse-gas concentrations. This increase in heat content has gone on unabated for at least the past forty years. Then I will show that differences between different model simulations – and hence also differences between simulations and observations – are dominated by chance events if we consider temperature changes over periods as short as fifteen years. By contrast, it matters little whether models respond more or less sensitively to increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations, if we only consider changes over fifteen years. The difference between simulated and observed global surface temperature changes during the hiatus period thus tells us very little about model capability or lack thereof, and as an indicator of anthropogenic climate change the surface-warming hiatus is largely irrelevant.

                                Dr. James Hansen, formerly Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, is an Adjunct Professor at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, where he directs the <a href="http://csas.ei.columbia.edu/">Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions</a>. He was trained in physics and astronomy in the space science program of Dr. James Van Allen at the University of Iowa. His early research on the clouds of Venus helped identify their composition as sulfuric acid. Since the late 1970s, he has focused his research on Earth’s climate, especially human-made climate change. Dr. Hansen is best known for his testimony on climate change to congressional committees in the 1980s that helped raise broad awareness of the global warming issue. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 and was designated by Time Magazine in 2006 as one of the 100 most influential people on Earth. He has received numerous awards including the Carl-Gustaf Rossby and Roger Revelle Research Medals, the Sophie Prize and the Blue Planet Prize. Dr. Hansen is widely recognized for his efforts to outline actions that the public must take to protect the future of young people and other life on our planet.

                                QUANDARY: Leveraging game-based learning to develop ethical thinking and decision making skills

                                QUANDARY, an award-winning game from the Learning Games Network, is a game that encourages players to think ethically as they lead a human colony struggling for survival on fictional planet Braxos. The game’s goal is to provide an engaging experience for players aged 8-14 to strengthen foundational skills – including perspective-taking, decision making and critical thinking – that help them recognize ethical issues and deal with ethical situations in their own lives.

                                In this workshop, we’ll explore how to integrate QUANDARY into the classroom by playing the game, viewing and discussing teacher example videos and tips, and reviewing players’ feedback. We’ll also look at extension ideas and support material available on the web, including teacher and player created scenarios. We’ll pull-out the concepts and design under-pinning the game: why we chose the dilemmas that are featured; why it was set on a fictional planet; how the scoring works; how we encourage discussion and reflection; what ethical theories underpin the game.

                                <strong>Participants will:</strong>
                                • Play the game
                                • Watch video clips of the game in use and kids’ reactions
                                • Hear how the game was designed
                                • Discuss one of the ethical dilemmas presented in the game
                                • Discuss how the game can be used in the classroom, and hopefully suggest and share new thoughts and extensions

                                <strong>Participants will gain:</strong>
                                • Confidence in using Quandary in their classroom, including tips and strategies that can be applied to game-based learning more generally
                                • Knowledge about the types of dilemmas and support materials available to facilitate ethical discussions in the classroom
                                • An understanding of the ethical research and frameworks used for the game (plus an opportunity to debate these choices and game design)
                                • An insight into the design and use of learning games

                                Las Facultades de Ciencia Política y Gobierno y de Relaciones Internacionales lo invitan a esta charla con gran relevancia en la coyuntura actual del país.

                                Colombia desea la paz, pero su conquista es un proceso que implica trabajo, aprendizaje y perseverancia. La reconstrucción de la confianza política y social, herida tras décadas de violencia, requiere de una sociedad valiente y dispuesta a otorgarse a sí misma el regalo del perdón.

                                Para asumir con libertad el compromiso de reparar los daños y edificar una sociedad fundada en el respeto y el cuidado mutuos, también hemos de preparar el terreno en nuestro interior, sembrando la semilla de la reconciliación con nuestro pasado y con nuestro país.

                                La paz es un proceso tanto político y público como personal, reservado e interior. Como no es posible conquistar una justicia política perfecta, hemos de trabajar internamente comprendiendo cada vez más la fragilidad de nuestra justicia humana, iluminándola y abrazándola con compasión. Pues sólo la compasión, la confianza y la firmeza pueden ayudarnos efectivamente a aprender del dolor, la culpa, la indignación y el resentimiento. Fortalecer la paz interior es también un factor determinante de la paz política. La conferencia es en inglés, con traducción simultánea al español.

                                <strong>A Program for Transformative Teachers: Cultivating Resilient and Ethical Young Leaders</strong>

                                <em>Become a Transformative Teacher!</em>

                                The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is offering intensive one-day “Transformative Teachers” workshops for high school and middle school teachers; providing teachers with the tools and methods for fostering resilient and ethical young leaders. This program supports two ongoing initiatives to develop ethics and leadership among youth: Young Peace Leaders, targeting elementary and middle school aged children, and Compassionate Young Leaders for young adults in high school and university.

                                <strong><em>Program Goals</em></strong>

                                Through interactive workshops that engage teachers in discussion, introspection and experimentation, the Transformative Teachers program trains teachers to integrate the development of cognitive skills, social-emotional understanding, and ethical purpose; enabling teachers to make a profound and lasting impact on their students.

                                Almost one in four American working adults has a job that pays less than a living wage. Conventional wisdom says that’s how the world has to work. Bad jobs with low wages, minimal benefits, little training, and chaotic schedules are the only way companies can keep costs down and prices low. Right?

                                <em>Wrong</em>. In an upcoming, complimentary webinar, <strong>The Good Jobs Strategy: Why Good Jobs Are Good for Businesses</strong>, MIT Sloan Professor <a href="http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/263-zeynep-ton">Zeynep Ton</a> examines how organizations can design and manage their operations in a way that everyone–employees, customers, and investors—wins. Referencing research from her popular book, <a href="http://zeynepton.com/book/"><em>The Good Jobs Strategy: </em><em>How the Smartest Companies Invest in Employees to Lower Costs and Boost Profits</em></a><em>, </em>Ton makes the compelling case that even in low-cost settings, leaving employees behind with bad jobs is a choice, not a necessity.

                                Join Professor Ton on June 26 to learn why the race to the bottom in retail employment (and other industries) doesn’t have to be the only game being played.

                                The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT and the Young Future Energy Leaders Program at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology are jointly organizing a unique summer program that will train social entrepreneurs in starting and running small businesses to extend energy access and enhance sustainable development for rural communities.  The course, “Compassionate Young Leaders Program on Energy Access, Ethics and Development”, will take place in August in both Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and in the city of Leh, the capital of the state of Ladakh; a mountainous state of Northwestern India with plentiful natural resources, but limited electricity infrastructure.

                                The course will provide a hands-on introduction to sustainable development issues, off-grid energy technologies, and community-based business models, culminating in group projects that focus on expanding energy access for the local community. Half of the students will come from India, and half will start the course in the UAE and then travel to Leh. The cross-cultural exchange and opportunity for creating entrepreneurial teams with access to technical know-how, capital, and local knowledge will be a key outcome of the course. Trainers for the course will include experts from MIT and the Masdar Institute, as well as energy access practitioners with experience in starting small energy enterprises.

                                    <strong>Half of the world</strong> population and three-quarters of all large cities are located on the coast. <strong>634 million people</strong> are at risk from rising water levels. How will our world landscapes change as a result? From New York City to Shanghai, Sydney to Rio de Janeiro—coastal cities have become the nexuses for today’s global economy, yet face a confounding duality in which they are also the most threatened by climate change. MIT is addressing these challenges of coastal cities at the 2014 MIT Sustainability Summit. The conference will <strong>defy traditional notions of urban development</strong> to ask how coastal cities can sustain themselves and <strong>continue to grow</strong> as the climate changes and their local environments deteriorate.

                                    Register now to <strong>learn what the future</strong> holds for these cities, what <strong>complex problems and exciting solutions</strong> exist and what they mean to you and the work you do, and <strong>how you can help</strong> overcome them to build sustainable coastal cities.

                                                        Lloyd H. Dean is a nationally recognized leader within and beyond the field of health care. He is president and CEO of Dignity Health, one of the nation’s five largest health care systems. His career in health care has spanned 25 years, during which he has brought operational discipline to leading health providers while also advocating strongly for reforms to the health system that would better align incentives to keep people healthy.

                                                        Since joining Dignity Health in 2000, Dean has strengthened and grown the organization into a national system with nearly $14 billion in assets and a reputation for high quality, compassionate care, operational excellence, and strong financial results. Last year, Dignity Health provided $1.7 billion in charitable care and services.

                                                        Dean is a board member of several companies including Wells Fargo &amp; Company and has previously served as Board Chair and Board of Trustees member for the Catholic Health Association of the United States.

                                                        A strong advocate for health care reform, Dean directly participated in reform discussions with President Barack Obama and has been appointed to the State Healthcare Cost Commission charged with developing practical state policies to contain health care costs in the nation.

                                We are pioneering a project-based seminar in which students will design, develop, and pilot digital media to support reading acquisition for young, at-risk children around the world (e.g., Africa, India, and the US). Students will be expected to learn theoretical aspects of language and reading development alongside basic app design principles that will be sufficient for them to help develop the specs for one app that has the potential to be developed further and ultimately taken into the field. The issues around apps proving positive opportunities for character development and ethical learning will be an important dimension of the course,  and students will be asked  to include such learning into their app designs as a secondary learning objective.

                                    <strong>Daniel Goleman</strong> is an internationally known psychologist who lectures frequently to professional groups, business audiences, and on college campuses. Working as a science journalist, Goleman reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for many years. His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half; with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide in 30 languages, and has been a best seller in many countries. Goleman’s latest book is Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything. The book argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better. Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, was published in 2006. Social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence, can now be understood in terms of recent findings from neuroscience. Goleman’s book describes the many implications of this new science, including for altruism, parenting, love, health, learning and leadership.

                                <strong>Science, Monks, and Technology (SMT Leadership Program)
                                </strong><em>Target: India, Nepal</em>

                                <strong>SMT Leadership Program</strong> aims to bridge the gap between theory and praxis for Tibetan monastic and science students by developing and implementing innovative solutions to address the immediate needs of the Tibetan diaspora community.

                                Participants will gain an understanding of ethics and values based leadership and entrepreneurship, while working in teams consisting of local community members and faculty and students from US universities. The strong service-learning component of this program requires that teams put their  model projects into action, whether they are solar solutions to generate electricity and potable water or the creation of a science center to incubate future learning opportunities.  Successful projects will have the ability to be scaled up to make greater impacts in the wider community.

                                <strong>SMT Leadership Program</strong> aims to bridge the gap between theory and praxis for Tibetan monastic and science students by developing and implementing innovative solutions to address the immediate needs of the Tibetan diaspora community.

                                Participants will gain an understanding of ethics and values based leadership and entrepreneurship, while working in teams consisting of local community members and faculty and students from US universities. The strong service-learning component of this program requires that teams put their  model projects into action, whether they are solar solutions to generate electricity and potable water or the creation of a science center to incubate future learning opportunities.  Successful projects will have the ability to be scaled up to make greater impacts in the wider community.

                                The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values at MIT and the Young Future Energy Leaders Program at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology are jointly organizing a unique summer program that will train social entrepreneurs in starting and running small businesses to extend energy access and enhance sustainable development for rural communities.  The course, “Compassionate Young Leaders Program on Energy Access, Ethics and Development”, will take place in August in both Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates and in the city of Leh, the capital of the state of Ladakh; a mountainous state of Northwestern India with plentiful natural resources, but limited electricity infrastructure.

                                The course will provide a hands-on introduction to sustainable development issues, off-grid energy technologies, and community-based business models, culminating in group projects that focus on expanding energy access for the local community. Half of the students will come from India, and half will start the course in the UAE and then travel to Leh. The cross-cultural exchange and opportunity for creating entrepreneurial teams with access to technical know-how, capital, and local knowledge will be a key outcome of the course. Trainers for the course will include experts from MIT and the Masdar Institute, as well as energy access practitioners with experience in starting small energy enterprises.

                                Whereas religious systems differ markedly in their theological views and ritual practices, the world’s religions and enlightened philosophical traditions find themselves in perfect accord on the essential importance of ethical integrity. At a time when the Islamic world and the West seem locked in an interminable symbolic conflict fraught with global peril, the ethical values that unite Islam and the West are a timely topic for exploration and celebration.

                                Across industries and government organizations around the globe, a systems-based approach is increasingly seen as critical to addressing the urgent and complex problems we face today. For many organizations, the question is not whether to employ systems thinking, but how to apply it to maintain competitive advantage.

                                The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s annual Conference on Systems Thinking for Contemporary Challenges, sponsored by the System Design and Management Program, will focus on addressing complexity and innovation in energy and managing complex data across industries. MIT has carefully chosen speakers not only for their expertise in addressing complex systems challenges, but also for their role in leading the implementation of the day-to-day tasks that produce results.

                                MIT professors will frame the three-fold nature of systems thinking—technical, managerial, and socio-political—and outline how it is being applied in these critical areas. Industry leaders will describe best practices that demonstrate the challenges they face within and outside of their organizations, how they apply a systems-based approach, the benefits achieved, and the lessons learned.

                                The aim of the conference is to provide practical information from multiple disciplines that will spark ideas for how to implement systems thinking and innovation to address complex challenges, whether in industry, academia, government, or the world at large.

                                    Tenzin Gyatso, the XIVth Dalai Lama, is a moral figure and spiritual leader revered worldwide. He was born to a farming family on July 6, 1935 in a small village called Taktser in northeastern Tibet. He was recognized, in accordance with Tibetan tradition, at the age of two as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the XIIIth Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lamas are believed to be Embodiments of Compassion, who choose to reincarnate for the purpose of serving humanity. Winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1989, he is universally respected as a spokesman for the compassionate and peaceful resolution of human conflict. Most recently he was awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 in recognition for his “many enduring and outstanding contributions to peace, non-violence, human rights and religious understanding.” He has traveled extensively, speaking on subjects including universal responsibility, love, compassion and kindness.His Holiness is committed to the promotion of the human values of compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, contentment and self-discipline – what he calls secular ethics – and also promotes religious harmony and understanding among the world’s major religious traditions.

                                    Brother David Steindl-Rast, O.S.B. was born in 1926 in Vienna, Austria.  He studied art, anthropology, and psychology, receiving a Ph.D. from the University of Vienna.  Since 1953 he has been a monk of Mount Saviour Benedictine monastery in New York.  He was one of the first Roman Catholics to participate in Buddhist-Christian dialogue.

                                    For decades, Brother David has divided his time between periods of a hermit’s life and extensive lecture tours. His audiences included starving students in Zaire and faculty at Harvard and Columbia, Buddhist monks and Sufi retreatants, New Age commune residents and naval cadets, Green Berets and international peace conference participants.

                                    He has contributed to books and periodicals from the <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em> to the <em>New Age Journal</em>. He authored <em>Gratefulness, the Heart of Prayer</em> and <em>A Listening Heart</em>, both reprinted and anthologized for more than two decades. Brother David co-authored <em>Belonging to the Universe,</em> with physicist, Fritjof Capra, and <em>The Ground We Share</em> on Buddhist and Christian practice with Robert Aitken Roshi. His most recent book is <em>Deeper Than Words: Living the Apostles’ Creed</em>.

                                    Brother David co-founded <a href="http://www.gratefulness.org/">www.gratefulness.org</a>, a website supporting ANG*L (A Network for Grateful Living). It reaches more than 8,000 visitors daily, from over 200 countries.

                                    Meng is Google’s Jolly Good Fellow (which nobody can deny). Like many things in Google, his unusual job title started as a joke, but eventually became real. Meng was one of Google’s earliest engineers. Among many other things, he helped build Google’s first mobile search service, and headed the team that kept a vigilant eye on Google’s search quality. After a successful 8-year stint in Engineering and 2 years as GoogleEDU’s Head of Personal Growth, he now serves with Google’s Talent Team.  His current job description is, “Enlighten minds, open hearts, create world peace”.

                                    One of Meng’s main projects at Google is a groundbreaking mindfulness-based emotional intelligence course called <em>Search Inside Yourself</em>, which was featured on the front page of the Sunday Business section of the New York Times. <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> is also the title of Meng’s New York Times bestselling book which has been endorsed by world leaders such as President Carter of the United States and President Nathan of Singapore, business leaders such as Eric Schmidt of Google and John Mackey of Whole Foods Markets, and spiritual leaders such as the Dalai Lama and Deepak Chopra. Meng hopes <em>Search Inside Yourself</em> will eventually contribute to world peace in a meaningful way.

                                    Outside of Google, Meng is the Founder and (Jolly Good) President of the Tan Teo Charitable Foundation, a small foundation dedicated to promoting Peace, Liberty and Enlightenment in the world. He is a Founder and the Chairman of the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute (SIYLI). He is a Founding Patron of Stanford University’s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE).  He is also a Founding Patron of the World Peace Festival, and adviser to a number of technology start-ups.

                                    Meng earned his MS in Computer Science from the University of California at Santa Barbara. He went to Santa Barbara mainly for the beach, but didn’t mind the graduate degree either. He has won many computing-related awards, including the Championship of Singapore’s National Software Competition. Prior to coming to the United States, Meng had a successful engineering career in Singapore. (He knew it was successful because nobody offered to fire him).

He is working on a book that argues that the intrinsic growth of people and institutions should be the primary focus of global development. Previously, Toyama co-founded Microsoft Research India, where he started an interdisciplinary research group to understand how electronic technology could support the socio-economic development of the world’s impoverished communities. The group’s projects – including Digital Green, MultiPoint, and Text-Free UI – have been seminal in ICT4D research, even as Toyama has gone on to be a vocal critic of techno-utopian hype in development. Prior to his time in India, he did computer vision research at Microsoft Research in Redmond, WA, USA and Cambridge, UK, and taught mathematics at Ashesi University in Accra, Ghana. Toyama graduated from Yale with a PhD in Computer Science and from Harvard with a bachelors degree in Physics.

                                    <strong>Shirin Ebadi</strong> is a lawyer, human rights activist, and the recipient of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize for her work defending the rights of women and children in Iran, and advocating an interpretation of Islam which is compatible with democracy and human rights. She is the first Iranian and Muslim woman to receive the prize. Ebadi received a law degree from the University of Tehran in 1965, and became one of the first female judges in Iran.

                                    In 1975, she was the first Iranian woman to preside over a legislative court. Following Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979, Ebadi was demoted to the position of a clerk in the court she had presided over because the revolution deemed women unfit to serve as judges. Unable to accept the discrimination against her, she resigned, and although her application was repeatedly rejected, finally obtained a license to open a law firm. For the next two decades, Ebadi devoted her life to the promotion of women’s rights, the defense of children, and political activists. Her organization, the Association for Human Rights Advocates, provides pro bono legal service to political prisoners in Iran. Shirin Ebadi has spoken out strongly against discrimination and injustice in her country, at times despite great risk to her own safety.

                                    In 2000, she spent a month in solitary confinement as a result of defending the family of a student killed by the police in protests in Tehran. Shirin Ebadi’s principal arena is the struggle for basic human rights and the fundamental value that political power in a community must be built on democratic elections. She favors dialogue as the best path to changing attitudes and resolving conflict, and as a conscious Muslim believes there is no conflict between Islam and fundamental human rights.

                                    Dr. Ebadi is the founder of three NGOs in Iran, The Association for the Defense of the Rights of the Child, The Association for Human Rights Advocates, and the Organization against Mines in Iran. She is the author of 14 books, including available in English a memoir Iran Awakening; Refugee Law in Iran; and, The Golden Cage.

                                    <strong>Susan S. Sibley
                                    </strong><em>Leon and Anne Goldberg Professor of Humanities, and Professor of Sociology and Anthropology, MIT</em>

                                    Professor Silbey is Leon and Anne Goldberg Professor of Humanities, and Professor of Sociology and Anthropology. Professor Silbey is the recipient of numerous prizes and awards including John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Fellowships (2009), the Harry Kalven Jr. Prize for advancing the sociology of law (2009), Doctor Honoris Causa from Ecole Normale Superiere Cachan, in Paris (2006). She is also Past President of the Law &amp; Society Association, and a fellow of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.

                                    Silbey received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago and post-graduate training in ethnography in the Sociology Department of Brandeis University. She has written about the social organization of law in diverse institutional and informal settings including attorney general’s offices, courts, schools, private homes, businesses and scientific laboratories; she has also studied alternative forms of dispute resolution including negotiation and mediation. She has edited Studies in Law, Politics and Society (1990-1997) and the Law &amp; Society Review (1998-2000). In 1998, she published The Common Place of Law: Stories from Everyday Life (with Patricia Ewick) describing the ways in which Americans imagine, use, and construct the rule of law, in 2003, In Litigation: Do the ‘Haves’ Still Come Out Ahead? (edited with Herbert Kritzer), and in 2008 Law and Science I, Epistemological, Evidentiary, and Relational Engagements, and Law and Science II, Regulation of Property, Practices, and Products.

                                    Silbey’s current research looks at the roles and conceptions of law in scientific laboratories, comparing the place of law in expert communities and popular culture, with special attention to the ways in which complex technological organizations observe and govern themselves. She is supervising an experiment in ethnographic fieldwork on the development of new safety regimes in research labs. In addition, she is completing a six year longitudinal study of engineering education, following a cohort of students through four different engineering schools.

                                “Why does this magnificent applied science which saves work and makes life easier bring us so little happiness? The simple answer runs: Because we have not yet learned to make sensible use of it.”

                                    Can mobile phones be used to improve rural healthcare?

                                    How do you design user interfaces for an illiterate migrant worker?

                                    What value is video technology to a farmer earning $1 a day?

                                    Interventionist projects in “information and communication technology for development” (ICT4D) seek to answer these kinds of questions, but the excitement has also generated excessive hype about the power of technology to solve the deep problems of poverty. In this talk, I will present several persistent myths of ICT4D, offer a theory of “technology as amplifier” which explains the gap between rhetoric and reality, and provide recommendations for engineers and scientists interested in contributing to a better world. My hope is to suggest that while technology might not save the world, technologists have much to contribute.

                                    Kentaro Toyama is a researcher in the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. He is working on a book that argues that the intrinsic growth of people and institutions should be the primary focus of global development. Previously, Toyama co-founded Microsoft Research India, where he started an interdisciplinary research group to understand how electronic technology could support the socio-economic development of the world’s impoverished communities.

                                Across industries and government organizations around the globe, a systems-based approach is increasingly seen as critical to addressing the urgent and complex problems we face today. For many organizations, the question is not whether to employ systems thinking, but how to apply it before it is too late.

                                The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s annual Conference on Systems Thinking for Contemporary Challenges, sponsored by the System Design and Management Program, will focus on addressing complexity and innovation in healthcare, education, and product development. MIT has carefully chosen speakers not only for their expertise in addressing complex systems challenges, but also for their role in leading the implementation of the day-to-day tasks that produce results.

                                MIT professors will frame the three-fold nature of systems thinking—technical, managerial, and socio-political—and outline how it is being applied in these critical areas. Industry leaders will describe best practices that demonstrate the challenges they face within and outside of their organizations, how they apply a systems-based approach, the benefits achieved, and the lessons learned.

                                The aim of the conference is to provide practical information from multiple disciplines that will spark ideas for how to implement systems thinking and innovation to address complex challenges, whether in industry, academia, government, or the world at large.

                                There will be ample time for Q&amp;A with speakers and networking with executives attending the conference.

                                Confirmed speakers include:

                                    <strong>Philip F. Mangano</strong> is President and CEO of The American Round Table to Abolish Homelessness, whose mission is to be a strategic partner with every level of government and every element of the private and faith-based sectors to prevent and end the long misery of homelessness for our poorest neighbors. Internationally recognized for his bold leadership on an issue seen as intractable, Mr. Mangano’s unique blend of business experience, public service, and personal commitment energize partners to focus on solutions. The Round Table is committed to strategies that are research and data driven, performance-based, consumer-centric, and results-oriented and to rapid dissemination of innovation, information, and inspiration to its partners. For the past seven years, Mr. Mangano led the national strategy to prevent and end homelessness in his position as the Executive Director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. Mr. Mangano was appointed as the Council’s Executive Director in 2002, serving under both President George Bush and in the first 100 days of the Obama Administration. Mangano’s successful results-oriented strategies and innovative initiatives focused the Council’s mission to coordinate the Federal response to homelessness and to create partnership throughout government and the private sector to end homelessness. His new strategies resulted in an unprecedented national partnership of 20 Federal agencies, 53 Governors, and over 1,000 Mayors and County Executives partnered in over 350 local jurisdictional Ten Year Plans. With his leadership, new interagency and community collaborations have been established across the country. The prioritization by the Council on the prevention of homelessness and rapid re-housing of homeless people focused Federal policy and encouraged local plans and investments from the public and private sectors.

                                    <strong>Robert V. Taylor</strong> is Chair of the Desmond Tutu Peace Foundation in New York. Born and raised in South Africa, Robert saw firsthand the potential for peace making when oppressed people find the courage to be who they are through discovering their voices and trusting their imagination. In 1980 his mentor, Archbishop Desmond Tutu sent Robert to the United States to avoid imprisonment for his anti-apartheid activity. A graduate of Rhodes University in South and Union Theological Seminary in New York he eventually became the highest ranking openly gay clergy person in the Episcopal Church at the time. He lectures nationally on compassion, peace-making and reconciliation engaging audience across the United States in realizing their full human potential and impact in the world.

                                    His lecture will address the way in which reconciling peacemaking is a grounding transformative ethic in our personal lives and in society reorienting how we perceive ourselves and others. He will explore the ways in which technology and social media offer ground breaking opportunities for creating a new normalcy to local and global peace-making and reconciliation, and how this expands our understanding of the inter-connectedness of all people with implications for reframing the landscape of power dynamics among diverse peoples. He will draw on his own involvement in creating an open source peace platform with its potential for a transformative ethic of human engagement.

                                    <strong>Daniel Goleman</strong> is an internationally known psychologist who lectures frequently to professional groups, business audiences, and on college campuses. Working as a science journalist, Goleman reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for many years. His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half; with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide in 30 languages, and has been a best seller in many countries. Goleman’s latest book is Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything. The book argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better. Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, was published in 2006. Social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence, can now be understood in terms of recent findings from neuroscience. Goleman’s book describes the many implications of this new science, including for altruism, parenting, love, health, learning and leadership.

                                The conference is about ethical issues arising from natural disasters and disaster relief.

                                <strong>Professor Jennifer Leaning</strong>, Director of the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights at the Harvard School of Public Health and Co-Director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, will be delivering a keynote address.

                                <strong>Dr. Sherri Fink</strong>, a MD and investigative journalist, will run an interactive simulation with conference attendees based on the story of the physicians and patients trapped inside a New Orleans hospital in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Faced with rapidly deteriorating patients in a hospital without electrical power and dwindling resources, respected physicians and nurses in the hospital decided to lethally inject at least 17 patients. Many of the patients were near death, but several were not. Their reasoning stemmed from the observation that while all individuals in the hospital were being evacuated, moving these patients appeared impossible. To leave them behind would be to likely condemn them to eventual agonizing death.

                                Dr. Fink’s piece required $400,000 to complete and is believed by many to be a contender for a Pulitzer Prize. The story forces us to ask, who should receive limited resources in disaster situations? Is it truly justifiable to do the greatest good for the greatest number? Should physicians be held accountable for their actions in such circumstances? The simulation will be a unique experience that conference attendees will never forget.

                                There will also be a number of breakout seminars led by professors and experts in the area. Refreshments will be provided.

                                Henrietta Lacks, known to scientists as HeLa, was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the effects of the atom bomb; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions—yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.

                                Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. The story of the Lacks family—past and present—is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.

                                Predicting the success of any new enterprise is difficult, but most social entrepreneurs face an added challenge: their lives bear little resemblance to the people they serve. This can significantly impede their understanding of what matters most to their customer, her priorities and concerns, resources, the constraints imposed by her environment, and the interplay between agents. Bridging this gap, and not technology per se, is arguably the chief determinant of success. While there is no substitute for gaining a deeper understanding of the community, in part by immersing oneself in it, this talk will draw lessons from past successes and failures to help us avoid common traps, and improve our chances of meaningfully serving our communities.

                                The stories we tell ourselves and our communities can generate suffering and block us from leading the lives we say we want. We will explore how such toxic narratives are viral in nature, how we become susceptible to their influence, and how they contribute to the perpetuation of cycles of trauma, violence, and poverty. We will begin to explore ways in which toxic narratives can be refashioned into more generative ones, and will derive insight and inspiration from the experiences of “narrative redemption” taking place in parts of Native America.

                                    <strong>Daniel Goleman</strong> is an internationally known psychologist who lectures frequently to professional groups, business audiences, and on college campuses. Working as a science journalist, Goleman reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for many years. His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half; with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide in 30 languages, and has been a best seller in many countries. Goleman’s latest book is Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything. The book argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better. Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, was published in 2006. Social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence, can now be understood in terms of recent findings from neuroscience. Goleman’s book describes the many implications of this new science, including for altruism, parenting, love, health, learning and leadership.

This research has led directly to the concept of X-Teams as a vehicle for driving innovation within large organizations. Her book, X-teams: How to Build Teams That Lead, Innovate, and Succeed was published by Harvard Business School Press in June, 2007.

                                    Deborah’s work has also focused on the concept of distributed leadership, and the development of research-based tools, practices, and teaching/coaching models that enable organizations to foster creative leadership at every level. This work was highlighted in a recent article in the Harvard Business Review, In Praise of the Incomplete Leader, February, 2007.

                                    In addition to X-Teams, Deborah’s studies of team performance have also been published in the Administrative Science Quarterly, the Academy of Management Journal, Organization Science, and the Sloan Management Review. Her previous book, Managing for the Future: Organizational Behavior and Processes (South-Western College Publishing, 1999, 2005) centers on the skills and processes needed in today’s diverse and changing organization.

                                    <strong>Dr. Aseem Inam</strong> has practiced as an architect, urban designer and planner in Los Angeles, Montreal, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, St. Louis, and Washington DC. Most recently, he led multidisciplinary teams on urbanist initiatives in the Caribbean, California, and on the U.S.-Mexico border. Early in his career, he created and lead the rural habitat development program in Gujarat, India. His essay, Meaningful Urban Design, received an Honorable Mention for the best writing on the future of American urbanism and was published in the Journal of Urban Design, and his book, Planning for the Unplanned: Recovering from Crises in Megacities, was published by Routledge, New York in 2005. In 2009 at MIT, he received the Excellence in Teaching Award in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning, and was selected as an inaugural Fellow at the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values.

                                    The talk is co-sponsored by the Residential Scholars Program at Simmons Hall and the Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values, and is supported by a generous contribution from the William R. (1956) and Betsy P. Leitch Endowment.

                                The paradox of urbanism is that those who are most capable of shaping cities (i.e. urban designers, architects, landscape architects) are among the least effective at transforming them. Urbanists possess the unique combination of being able to directly address the four-dimensional issues of place, creative thinking skills, interdisciplinary approaches to problem solving, and engagement with city-building processes on a daily basis. However, urbanists also view cities as the production of material objects, and their singular obsession with form and space renders them impotent in the face of powerful decision-making processes and larger power structures.

                                Drawing from the work of American pragmatist philosophers Charles Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and Richard Rorty, the talk outlines a conceptual shift to render the practice of urbanism more relevant and effective in the face of critical urban challenges. The shift consists of viewing the city as flux rather than just as object, focusing on consequences rather than just intentions, and design as a creative political act rather than just a form-making exercise. The talk illustrates the conceptual shift with case studies of the author’s experiments in urbanism in professional practice and pedagogy. In order to make a meaningful difference in the city, urbanists have to view their creative practices as driven by moral choices and consequential impacts.

                                Making its world premiere at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, Sin Nombre is an epic dramatic thriller from award-winning director Cary Fukunaga.

                                Seeking the promise of America, a beautiful young Honduran woman, Sayra (Paulina Gaytan), joins her father and uncle on an odyssey to cross the gauntlet of the Latin American countryside en route to the United States. Along the way she crosses paths with a teenaged Mexican gang member, El Casper (Edgar M. Flores), who is maneuvering to outrun his violent past and elude his unforgiving former associates. Together they must rely on faith, trust and street smarts if they are to survive their increasingly perilous journey towards the hope of new lives.

                                    <strong>Alan Wallace, Ph.D.</strong> a scholar and practitioner of Buddhism since 1970, has taught Buddhist theory and meditation throughout Europe and America since 1976. Having devoted fourteen years to training as a Tibetan Buddhist monk, ordained by H. H. the Dalai Lama, he went on to earn an undergraduate degree in physics and the philosophy of science at Amherst College and a doctorate in religious studies at Stanford.

                                    With his unique background, Alan brings deep experience and applied skills to the challenge of integrating traditional Indo-Tibetan Buddhism with the modern world.

                                In this workshop Dr. Alan Wallace will present methods drawn from the Buddhist contemplative tradition and modern psychology for cultivating emotional balance. Such practices are based on the distinction between hedonic pleasure, which is aroused by pleasant stimuli, and genuine happiness, which stems from what we bring to the world rather than what we get from it. In Buddhist practice, mental balance is cultivated on the basis of an ethical way of life, and it is developed within the broader context of conative, attentional, and cognitive balance. Central to such mental training is the development of attentional and metacognitive skills, which are indispensable for cultivating emotional balance.

                                    <strong>Clifford Saron, Ph.D.</strong> is currently an Assistant Research Scientist at the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California at Davis (http://mindbrain.ucdavis.edu), and faculty member of the UC Davis M.I.N.D. Institute. He received his Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1999 studying interhemispheric visuomotor integration under the direction of Herbert Vaughan, Jr. Dr. Saron has had a long-standing interest in brain and behavioral effects of meditation practice. He is Principal Investigator of The Shamatha Project, a unique longitudinal study of the effects of intensive meditation training based on the practice of meditative quiescence (shamatha) and cultivation of the four immeasureables (loving kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity) on attention-related skills and emotion regulation. The Shamatha Project is the most comprehensive and multimethod study to date regarding the potential effects of long-term intensive meditation practice on basic mental and physical processes related to cognition, emotion, and motivation. His other primary research interest focuses on investigating brain and behavioral correlates of sensory processing and multisensory integration in children on the autistic spectrum.

                                The operas Einstein on the Beach, Satyagraha Akhnaten and The Voyage, among many others play throughout the world’s leading houses, and rarely to an empty seat. Glass has written music for experimental theater and for Academy Award-winning motion pictures such as The Hours and Martin Scorsese’s Kundun, while Koyaanisqatsi, his initial filmic landscape with Godfrey Reggio and the Philip Glass Ensemble, may be the most radical and influential mating of sound and vision since Fantasia. His associations, personal and professional, with leading rock, pop and world music artists date back to the 1960s, including the beginning of his collaborative relationship with artist Robert Wilson. Indeed, Glass is the first composer to win a wide, multi-generational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film and in popular music — simultaneously.

                                He was born in 1937 and grew up in Baltimore. He studied at the University of Chicago, the Juilliard School and in Aspen with Darius Milhaud. Finding himself dissatisfied with much of what then passed for modern music, he moved to Europe, where he studied with the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger (who also taught Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and Quincy Jones) and worked closely with the sitar virtuoso and composer Ravi Shankar. He returned to New York in 1967 and formed the Philip Glass Ensemble seven musicians playing keyboards and a variety of woodwinds, amplified and fed through a mixer.

                                The new musical style that Glass was evolving was eventually dubbed minimalism. Glass himself never liked the term and preferred to speak of himself as a composer of music with repetitive structures. Much of his early work was based on the extended reiteration of brief, elegant melodic fragments that wove in and out of an aural tapestry. Or, to put it another way, it immersed a listener in a sort of sonic weather that twists, turns, surrounds, develops.
                                There has been nothing minimalist about his output. In the past 25 years, Glass has composed more than twenty operas, large and small; eight symphonies (with others already on the way); two piano concertos and concertos for violin, piano, timpani, and saxophone quartet and orchestra; soundtracks to films ranging from new scores for the stylized classics of Jean Cocteau to Errol Morris documentary about former defense secretary Robert McNamara; string quartets; a growing body of work for solo piano and organ. He has collaborated with Paul Simon, Linda Ronstadt, Yo-Yo Ma, and Doris Lessing, among many others. He presents lectures, workshops, and solo keyboard performances around the world, and continues to appear regularly with the Philip Glass Ensemble.

                                    <strong>Daniel Goleman</strong> is an internationally known psychologist who lectures frequently to professional groups, business audiences, and on college campuses. Working as a science journalist, Goleman reported on the brain and behavioral sciences for The New York Times for many years. His 1995 book, Emotional Intelligence (Bantam Books) was on The New York Times bestseller list for a year-and-a-half; with more than 5,000,000 copies in print worldwide in 30 languages, and has been a best seller in many countries. Goleman’s latest book is Ecological Intelligence: How Knowing the Hidden Impacts of What We Buy Can Change Everything. The book argues that new information technologies will create “radical transparency,” allowing us to know the environmental, health, and social consequences of what we buy. As shoppers use point-of-purchase ecological comparisons to guide their purchases, market share will shift to support steady, incremental upgrades in how products are made – changing every thing for the better. Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships, was published in 2006. Social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence, can now be understood in terms of recent findings from neuroscience. Goleman’s book describes the many implications of this new science, including for altruism, parenting, love, health, learning and leadership.

                                    <strong>Fr. Thomas Keating, O.C.S.O.</strong> (born 1923) is a Trappist monk (Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance) and priest. He was born in New York City, and attended Deerfield Academy, Yale University, and Fordham University, graduating in December 1943. He is a founder of the Centering Prayer movement and of Contemplative Outreach, Ltd.

                                    Keating entered the Cistercian Order in Valley Falls, Rhode Island in January, 1944. He was appointed Superior of St. Benedict’s Monastery, Snowmass, Colorado in 1958, and was elected abbot of St. Joseph’s Abbey, Spencer, Massachusetts in 1961. He returned to Snowmass after retiring as abbot of Spencer in 1981, where he established a program of ten-day intensive retreats in the practice of Centering Prayer, a contemporary form of the Christian contemplative tradition.

                                    He is one of three architects of Centering Prayer, a contemporary method of contemplative prayer, that emerged from St. Joseph’s Abbey in 1975. Frs. William Menninger and Basil Pennington, also Cistercian monks, were the other architects. In 1984, along with Gustave Reininger and Edward Bednar, he co-founded Contemplative Outreach, Ltd., an international, ecumenical spiritual network that teaches the practice of Centering Prayer and Lectio Divina, a method of prayer drawn from the Christian contemplative tradition. Contemplative Outreach provides a support system for those on the contemplative path through a wide variety of resources, workshops, and retreats. Fr. Keating also helped found the Snowmass Interreligious Conference in 1982 and is a past president of the Temple of Understanding and of the Monastic Interreligious Dialogue among other interreligious activities.

                                    Fr. Keating is author of several books and lives at St. Benedict’s Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado.

                                    Born in Mauritania, raised in Mali, trained as filmmaker in the Soviet Union and residing in France and Ethiopia, Abderrahmane Sissako will be Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at MIT from April 19-May 2, 2009. While at MIT, Sissako will be investigating economic violence in Africa.

                                    Sissako’s films meditate on Africa’s position in a globalized world. A past recipient of the Geneviève McMillan and Reba Stewart Fellowship for Distinguished Filmmaking at the Harvard Film Archives (HFA)will be returning to HFA for a screening of Bamako on April 20th. Bamako marks a departure from Sissako’s recent work, turning away from the film-essay of Life on Earth (1998) and the observational style of Waiting for Happiness (2002) to instead fuse modernist aesthetics with populist elements from any number of genres. The film’s Brechtian centerpiece is a trial, held in the Malian capital of Bamako, whose defendant is Western capitalism itself, facing charges that it has forcibly kept a decolonized Africa impoverished and oppressed. Alternating between the monologues that make up the testimony and a series of episodes from the daily life that continues around the trial – and sometimes interrupts (or even undermines) the proceedings – Sissako continues to explore the intertwining of public and private, global and local, modern and traditional so central to his earlier films, although now with a broader palate of tones than before, ranging from the farcical to the ironic and from the satirical to the quietly tragic.
